# pump-probe-experiment-control 

Pump-probe experiment control is the graphical user interface (GUI) that designed to simplify, automatize, and visualize the data acquisition process.

This GUI is the "single-page" window with inputs for the time-resolved scan parameters, Lock-in Amplifier (LIA) controls, alignment tools, and plots with measured data sets. 

It was made with the intent of user-friendly software configuration, hardware initialization and modifiability of the GUI itself. No prior programming knowledge required.
